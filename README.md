Github repo for the blog post [here](https://warproxxx.github.io/Bitcoin-Trend/)

This repo is quiet rough. But there is enough to replicate the analysis if you put effort. First use the gather_data script to download trades data from bitmex. Then go to the notebooks from 1 to 3 to replicate. The names are clear enough. And this script has a lot of potential.
